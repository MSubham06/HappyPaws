# HappyPaws – Spring PetClinic Application
Care for Every Paw!🐾🤝

**[Visit Website](https://msubham06.github.io/HappyPaws/)**



HappyPaws is a full-stack web application developed using React and Spring Boot, based on the modern Spring PetClinic architecture. The project demonstrates real-world enterprise application development practices such as layered architecture, RESTful APIs, database persistence, and role-based security.

This project is submitted as a Final Year B.Tech project for the Computer Science & Machine Learning (CSM) program at SVCET, Chittoor.

## Project Overview

The traditional Spring PetClinic application mainly focuses on backend concepts and does not reflect modern enterprise-level development. HappyPaws enhances this by integrating a React-based frontend with a Spring Boot backend, making it closer to a production-oriented full-stack application.

The system is designed to manage veterinary clinic operations including owners, pets, visits, and veterinarians through a centralized and structured platform.

## Objectives

- To design and develop a full-stack web application using React and Spring Boot  
- To implement CRUD operations on real-world entities  
- To follow layered architecture principles  
- To build RESTful APIs with proper database persistence  
- To create a clean, maintainable, and easy-to-understand reference project  

---

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- React.js  v18.2.0   
- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- JavaScript (ES6+)  

### Backend
- Java v17 
- Spring Boot v3.9.5 
- Spring MVC v6.1.x 
- Spring Data JPA  v3.2.x
- Spring Security  

### Database
- MySQL v8.0.x 

### Tools

- Maven v3.9.5 
- Git and GitHub v2.40+ 
- Postman v10+ 

---

## Modules Implemented

- Owner Module  
- Pet Module  
- Visit Module  
- Veterinarian Module  
- Authentication and Authorization Module  

---

## Key Features

- User authentication and authorization  
- Role-based access control  
- Owner, pet, visit, and veterinarian management  
- RESTful API-based frontend and backend communication  
- Secure and modular layered architecture  

---

## System Architecture

The application follows a Client–Server Architecture model:

- The frontend is developed using React and handles user interactions  
- Communication between frontend and backend is performed using RESTful APIs with JSON data  
- The backend is developed using Spring Boot and follows a layered architecture  
- The database layer uses MySQL with object–relational mapping through JPA  
- Security is implemented using Spring Security with role-based access control  

---

## How to Run the Project

### Backend
- Open the backend project in VS Code or IntelliJ  
- Configure the MySQL database details in the application properties file  
- Run the Spring Boot application  

### Frontend
- Navigate to the frontend project folder  
- Install the required dependencies  
- Start the React application

## Limitations

- Designed for single-clinic usage  
- Uses basic security mechanisms  
- Does not support real-time notifications  
- Not optimized for large-scale or high-traffic deployment  

---

## Future Enhancements

- JWT-based authentication and authorization  
- Deployment on cloud platforms such as AWS or GCP  
- Mobile application development  
- Migration to a microservices-based architecture  
- Integration of AI-based pet health analysis and recommendations
